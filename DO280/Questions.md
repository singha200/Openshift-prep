- Add `leader` user in `leaders` group. 
- Add `raja` user in `developers` group. 
- Assign the `qa-engineer` user to the `qa` group.
- Give `edit` permission to `leaders` group members to `back-end` and `app-db` projects.
- Give `view` permission to `qa` group members to `front-end` project.

# Question 4. Protect External Traffic with TLS
### Create secure Route  with below information
- Create a secure route in `quart` project.
- Expose application https://anishrana2001.apps.ocp4.example.com
- Generate self sign certificate using given  subject	
- "/C=US/ST=North Carolina/L=Raleigh/O=Red Hat/CN=anishrana2001.apps.ocp4.example.com"
- Note: Service already  created  in any given project you just have to expose  service  with https
- The application should produce the output
---


# Question 5. An application is running on the `red` project. There is one pod running and your task is it must generate the output.

# Question 6. Create a Service Account called `ex280-sa` in a `alpha` project. This project is already created for you.
- There is an application already running.
- ServiceAccoun should be associated with anyuid SCC
---

# Question 7. Deploy application in the project `alpha`:
- There is one pod already running
- Modify the application as is should run with any user as provided by application
- Application should produce output
---


# Question 8. Create secret with named `ex280-secret` in `cloud` project. The key name should be `MYSQL_PASSWORD` and the value of key should be `redhat123`

---
# Question 9. Use the secret `ex280-secret` in project `cloud`
- There is one pod already exist
- It should use ex280-secret secret previously created.
- Application should produce output.
---
# Question 10. Create Resources Quota with below information for project `beta`
- Quota Name is `ex280-quota`
- Maximum  Pods `7` and Service ip `6` and Replication Controller `5` 
- Memory `1G` and cpu core is `1`
--- 

# Question 11. Create LimitRange for project `orange`:
- Set the `pod memory limit` between `5Mi and 300Mi`
- Set the `container memory limit` between `5Mi and 300Mi` and container `default memory request` is `100Mi`
- Set the `pod cpu limit` between `5m and 300m`
- Set the `container cpu limit` between `5m and 300m` and container `default request limit for cpu` is `100m`
---

## Question 12. Scale the single-pod replicas to `5` under the project `tiger` and all pods should run.
---

# Question 13. Configure `Resource Request` & `limits` into deployment and Apply `AutoScale Rule` in the project `scalling`.
- Minimum replicas = 2 , Maximum replicas = 5 and cpu percentage = 50%
- Default request for containers memory should 100Mi and CPU 50m
---

# Question 14. Install an helm chart etherpad from repository http://helm.ocp4.example.com/charts
---

# Question 15. Create a cronjob `test-cron` in the `tiger' project
- `04:05` time
- Every 2 day and every month
- Use image `registry.io/nginx`
- Use service account and service account name is `ex280-sa`
- Successful job history limit `14`
- Project name should be `tiger`
- Create a cronjob using webconsole or take yaml from documentation
---

# Question 16. Question: create an network policy to connect two pod which are resides in different projects

- First pod is in `network-policy` namespace and second is in `different-namespace` project
- Pod in project `different-namespace` should communicate with `network-policy pod`
- Create an network policy with name `allow-specific`
- Policy uses labels to specify namespace with `network: different-namespace` and for pods selector
- Uses label `env=production`
- Use port `8080/tcp`
- Check the logs of `different-namespace pod` for verification
---

# Question 17. Create PV, PVC and then deployment.
- **Create a pv**
	- Name is tiger-pv
	- Size: `1Gi`
	- Policy: `retain`
	- Mode: `ReadOnlyMany`
- **Create a pvc**
	- Name is `tiger-pvc`
	- Size same as pv
	- Mount pvc to `/usr/share/nginx/html`
	- Project name is `page`
	- Mode same as pv
- **Create an Deployment with**
	- Name of deployment is `tiger`
	- Image is  `registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/redhattraining/hello-world-nginx:v1.0`
	- Application uses this link to show output http://contet.example.oco4.com
	- After attaching storage it shows desired output
---


# Question 18. Question: Create an project template with limitrange with container
- minimum memory is 5Mi, max is 1Gi. `defaultrequest` 254 Mi `defaultlimit` is 512 Mi .
- make sure this template available as default request `new-project` template for users.
---

# Question 19. Create a `Liveliness` Health Probe in project `tuesday` which has 1 pod running
- With port `8443`
- Initial delay of `3 sec`
- Time out for the probe is `10 sec`
- Probe must survive atleast `3` crash
---

- Use command tar cvaf
- One script has been provided to upload tar in redhat support
- /usr/bin/script student101<cluster.id>.tar.gz
- This script can be performed multiple times and it will overwrite the tar file every time
