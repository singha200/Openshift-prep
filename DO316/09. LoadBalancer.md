# Create a service using VirtualMachine load balancing
### In the Project `kiwi` create the following Objects:

- Using the temaple `tmprhl9small` which you created previously, instantiate two identical VirtualMachine named `web1` and `web2`
- Create a service name `ex316-kiwi-svc`
    Type: NodePort
    Pod Selector: app=web
- TCP Port `21` of each VM is connected to any workernode port on `30021`
- Create a route named web-route so that above service will be availabled at address `anishrana2001-lb.apps.ocp4.example.com`
- Perform the SSH to anishrana2001-lb.apps.ocp4.example.com
- port 21 , Database port = 3306
---

### Solution:

### Step 1. Select the project `kiwi` in the RedHat console 
### Step 2. Create the VMs `web1` & `web2` from the template ``
### Step 3. Add the label on VM and then restart it.

```
oc edit vm/web1
oc edit vm/web1
virtctl restart web1
virtctl restart web2
```

### Step 4. Verify the VM's Label.
```
oc get vm,vmi -l app=web
```
- Create a service name `ex316-kiwi-svc`
    - Type: NodePort
    - Pod Selector: app=web
    - TCP Port 3306 of each VM is connected to any worker node port 23
### Traffic first, reach to WorkerNode on Port 23 and then it will be forward to VMi on Port 3306. It means `--tcp=23:3306`

  
### Step 5. Create a service and modify the NodeSelector. In the end check the endpoints. It should point to web1 and web2 VM's IP.
```
oc create service nodeport ex316-kiwi-svc --tcp=21:30021
oc edit service/ex316-kiwi-svc
oc get endpoints ex316-kiwi-svc
```
- Create a route named web-route so that above service will be availabled at address `anishrana2001-lb.apps.ocp4.example.com`
### Create a route.
```
oc expose service ex316-kiwi-svc --hostname=anishrana2001-lb.apps.ocp4.example.com
```
